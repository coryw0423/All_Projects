% EGR150 SectionNN: Final Project Agreement.
FullName = 'Cory Wilson'; % <-- your name, not mine!
ProjectName = 'Point of Sale GUI'; % <-- Creative but realistic.
Description = 'A point of sale system that also tracks inventory'; % <-- Short but descriptive
Category = 'Inventory'; % will add posibilities. To begin with, choose one from the following:
    % Engineering, Educational, Mathematical, Inventory, Image, Game
FileName = 'HomeScreenPOS.fig'; % Name of your main .fig file.

% Summary: The purpose of this document is two fold.  First, to make you
% think through your project in advance, allowing feedback and give you a
% course of action to follow - i.e. increase your chances at having a
% really good final project.  The goals you define are your attempt at
% fulfilling the requirements for the project and will amount to a
% "contract" between you are our class.  That is not meant to scare or
% intimadate you, more to motivate you try your best, try something new and
% show to yourself and others what your are now capable of doing in Matlab.
% Your goals for the project must be approved by me and may change
% *slightly* over the course of the project.  Second, your goals will be
% presented to the EGR150 SectionNN at presentation time to track your
% progress from initial idea to final presentation.  

% Fill in the information above and goals below (email me before adding 
% more - I do not want your project to be too small OR too big!), run your
% FinalProjectAgreement.m (yes, this is a script just like our tests,
% homework and assessments).

% Save it in L:\EGR150\SectionNN\Drop\<BlazerID>\FinalProject or email it 
% back to me by TBD midnight (sooner is better as I can provide more 
% interactive feedback).  Also, I will need to approve your idea (we will
% discuss how to handle this later).  There will also be an image "sketch"
% deliverable that is TBD at this time.

% Goals: Don't be too formal (this is not an essay) but also not too
% simple.  Make them understandable and practical enough to make your
% project a useable final product.  In addition, show how they meet a
% requirement.  If you are having trouble, start with "I will... " or "It
% will... "

% Grading: Some minor changes may occur between now and the presentations.
% However this is very, very close to what you can expect.
